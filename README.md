My solutions to the puzzles at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Running these is done by typing:

`cargo run [20]YY [D]D [1/2]`

e.g.

`cargo run 19 5` to run both parts of 2019 day 5

`cargo run 20 23 1` to run just part 1 of 2020 day 23

`cargo run 2021 14 2` to run just part 2 of 2021 day 14
